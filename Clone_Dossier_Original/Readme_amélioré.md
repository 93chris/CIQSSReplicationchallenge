Data Documentation
This document describes the meaning of files that are necessary to replicate results in “International Students and Labor Market Outcomes of U.S. Natives” at the Canadian Journal of Economics by Murat Demirci.
“Demirci_CJE_2020.dta” is the data file in STATA format. The data set includes data from the American Community Survey for the years between 2009 and 2012. The sample is restricted to recent graduate bachelor's-degree holders (i.e., age below 24) and doctoral degree holders (aged below 31) and all master's degree holders in the data.
“Demirci_CJE_2020_figure1.dta” is the data file that is necessary to replicate Figure 1. It includes the IPEDS data that show the number of degrees granted to international students between 1977 and 2015.
“Demirci_CJE_2020_figure2.dta” is the data file that is necessary to replicate Figure 2. It includes the SEVIS data that show the potential and actual labor supply of international students on F-visas between 2004 and 2012.
“Demirci_CJE_2020.do” is the code in STATA format. It replicates all tables and figures of the paper. Table 1 and Table 2 are summary statistics. The code generates them while running, and this output can be accessed via the log file. Table 3 to Table 6 are regression outputs. The code runs them quietly and save the results in Excel files, named as Table 3 and so on. Both Figure 1 and 2 have six sub-panels. The code generates and saves them in .PNG format.

The data about the supply of international students are obtained from the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement via the Freedom of Information Act Request. (See https://www.ice.gov/foia/overview.) The data set includes visa and educational records of international students who completed their studies between 2004 and 2014 from the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).
Source for the National Survey of Recent College Graduates
The descriptive features of labor market outcomes of recent college graduates that are reported in the bottom panel of Table 1 are tabulated based on the 2008 and 2010 waves of the National Survey of Recent College Graduates. The restricted-use version of these data where all variables can be observed was used at the University of Virginia.
